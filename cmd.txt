✅ Goal: Remove/re-authenticate GitHub account (HTTPS credentials)
🔧 Solution: Clear GitHub login (credentials) from Windows and re-authenticate
🪟 Step-by-step for Windows:
1. Open Windows Credential Manager

Press Windows key

Type: Credential Manager and open it

Go to Windows Credentials

Scroll and find any entry like:

git:https://github.com


❌ Click it and press Remove/Delete

This will remove saved GitHub credentials (currently rehan5039).

2. Try pushing again:
git push origin main


This time Git will ask:

Username → its-anya

Password → ⚠️ Use a Personal Access Token (PAT), not your GitHub password

🔑 How to get Personal Access Token:

Visit: https://github.com/settings/tokens

Click “Generate new token (classic)”

Give it a name and expiry

Select scopes:

repo

workflow (optional)

Generate and copy it — you won’t see it again

When git asks for password, paste this token.
