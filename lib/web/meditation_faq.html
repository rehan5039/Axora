        <h2>Getting Started</h2>
        
        <details>
            <summary>How to start meditation?</summary>
            <div>
                <p>Start with just 5 minutes daily in a quiet space. Focus on your breath, and when your mind wanders, gently bring it back to your breathing. Gradually increase your time as you become more comfortable.</p>
                <p>Remember: consistency is more important than duration. A daily 5-minute practice is more beneficial than an occasional 30-minute session.</p>
            </div>
        </details>

        <details>
            <summary>What time of day is best for meditation?</summary>
            <div>
                <p>Many people prefer meditating in the morning to start their day with clarity, but the best time is whenever you can consistently practice. Find a time when you won't be disturbed and can make it part of your daily routine.</p>
                <p>Some find that meditating first thing in the morning, before checking emails or social media, helps set a positive tone for the day. Others prefer evening meditation to unwind and process the day's events.</p>
            </div>
        </details>

        <details>
            <summary>How long should I meditate?</summary>
            <div>
                <p>For beginners, 5-10 minutes daily is an excellent start. As you build your practice, you can gradually extend to 15-20 minutes. Consistency matters more than duration - regular short sessions are better than occasional long ones.</p>
                <p>The Axora app offers guided meditations of various lengths, so you can choose what works for your schedule on any given day.</p>

        <h2>Meditation Techniques</h2>

        <details>
            <summary>What is mindfulness meditation?</summary>
            <div>
                <p>Mindfulness meditation involves focusing on the present moment, usually by paying attention to your breath, bodily sensations, or surroundings without judgment. When thoughts arise, you acknowledge them and gently return to your focus.</p>
                <p>This practice helps train your attention and awareness, allowing you to become more present in everyday life and less reactive to stress.</p>
            </div>
        </details>

        <details>
            <summary>What is Third Eye meditation?</summary>
            <div>
                <p>Third Eye meditation focuses on the area between your eyebrows (the Ajna chakra). It involves directing your attention to this point to enhance intuition, clarity, and spiritual awareness. It's believed to help access deeper states of consciousness.</p>
                <p>To practice, sit comfortably and visualize a point of light in the center of your forehead. Maintain gentle focus on this point while breathing naturally.</p>
            </div>
        </details>

        <details>
            <summary>How does guided meditation work?</summary>
            <div>
                <p>Guided meditation uses verbal instructions to direct your attention and imagination. It's excellent for beginners as it provides structure and helps keep your mind from wandering. In Axora, you can choose from various guided meditations tailored to specific goals.</p>
                <p>The guide's voice helps maintain focus and offers specific visualizations or techniques to enhance your practice, making meditation more accessible for those who find it challenging to meditate in silence.</p>

        <h2>Common Challenges</h2>

        <details>
            <summary>How do I deal with a wandering mind?</summary>
            <div>
                <p>A wandering mind is normal, not a failure. When you notice your thoughts drifting, acknowledge it without judgment and gently redirect your attention back to your breath or meditation focus. This gets easier with practice.</p>
                <p>Each time you notice your mind wandering and bring your attention back, you're strengthening your ability to focus - that's the real practice of meditation.</p>
            </div>
        </details>

        <details>
            <summary>How to deal with physical discomfort while sitting?</summary>
            <div>
                <p>Start with shorter sessions and use proper support like cushions or chairs. Don't force uncomfortable positions; meditation doesn't require perfect lotus posture. You can even meditate lying down if needed, though this may lead to sleepiness.</p>
                <p>Experiment with different positions to find what works for your body. Remember, meditation is about mental focus, not physical endurance.</p>
            </div>
        </details>

        <details>
            <summary>What if I fall asleep during meditation?</summary>
            <div>
                <p>This is common, especially when tired. Try meditating when you're more alert, sit upright instead of lying down, open your eyes slightly, or practice in a cooler room. If you do fall asleep, don't worry - you likely needed the rest.</p>
                <p>Sometimes falling asleep indicates you're relaxing deeply. As your practice develops, you'll learn to maintain a state of alert relaxation without drifting off.</p>

    <section id="benefits">
        <h2>Benefits & Progress</h2>

        <details>
            <summary>How long before I see benefits from meditation?</summary>
            <div>
                <p>Some benefits like reduced stress may be noticed after just a few sessions. More significant changes to focus, emotional regulation, and overall well-being typically develop over weeks or months of consistent practice. Everyone's experience differs.</p>
                <p>Research suggests that measurable changes in brain structure can occur after 8 weeks of regular practice. The key is consistency rather than intensity.</p>

        <details>
            <summary>Can meditation help with anxiety?</summary>
            <div>
                <p>Yes, research shows meditation can significantly reduce anxiety by calming the mind, regulating stress hormones, and teaching you to observe anxious thoughts without being consumed by them. Regular practice can build resilience against anxiety triggers.</p>
                <p>Specific meditation techniques can help create distance between yourself and anxious thoughts, allowing you to respond to challenges with greater calm and clarity.</p>
            </div>
        </details>

        <details>
            <summary>How do I know if I'm making progress?</summary>
            <div>
                <p>Progress in meditation isn't always obvious. Look for subtle changes like increased awareness of your thoughts, better emotional regulation, improved focus, or enhanced ability to return to the present moment. The Axora app helps track your consistency, which is key to progress.</p>
                <p>Often, others will notice changes in your behavior and demeanor before you do. You might find yourself responding more thoughtfully to situations that would have triggered stress or reactivity before.</p>
